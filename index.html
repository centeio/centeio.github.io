                    <p class="lead mb-5">Hello there! I am Carolina, born in Porto (Portugal) and graduated in Computer Science and Engineering (with a focus on Data & AI). Since then, I have lived in a few places, picked up some languages, and collected different interests.
                        I am a problem-solver who prefers multi-disciplinary and diverse environments. While I am happy to learn about virtually anything, I am mainly passionate about collaborative technology, human behaviour, arts and cultures. I pay great attention to detail, and I love solving all types of puzzles, especially through brainstorming.</p>
                    <p class="lead mb-5">I am currently finishing my PhD at the Interactive Intelligence group of TU Delft. During my PhD, I was a visiting researcher at the University of Michigan (Ann Arbor) for two months. In Delft, I chaired my faculty's PhD council and I am currently a member of the university's Integrity Board.</p>
                    <p class="lead mb-5"><b>Looking for jobs</b> in the following positions: automation/AI/HCI R&D, data science, policy-making, intelligence analysis, partnerships coordination, behaviour analysis, research consultancy. Preferably in the Netherlands, Portugal, or remote work.</p>

                    <p class="lead mb-5">I am currently finishing my PhD at TU Delft, the Netherlands. Before my PhD, I earned my Master's in Informatics and Computing Engineering from the University of Porto (FEUP) in 2019, with Erasmus semesters at UPC (Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya), in Barcelona, and University of Twente, in the Netherlands.
                        From 2019 to 2020, I had the privilege to spend a year in Tokyo as part of the EU program Vulcanus in Japan, where I interned at <a href="https://www.omron.com/sinicx/">Omron Sinic X Corporation.</a>.</p>
                    <p class="lead mb-5">My <b>professional goal</b> is to support the sustainable development of science and innovation by connecting people from different research fields and cultural backgrounds. </p>

                    <p class="lead mb-5">I am a PhD candidate in the Interactive Intelligence group at Delft University of Technology (TU Delft) in the Netherlands.
                        My primary research interests are in behavior analysis and pattern recognition. My PhD work focuses on mental models in the context of human-AI teams, with the goal of enabling artificial agents (e.g., robots) to understand their human teammates and respond to them transparently and effectively.
                        Specifically, I have been investigating the concept of artificial trust in decision-making within human-AI teamwork, particularly in modeling context-dependent human trustworthiness for collaboration scenarios. Between September and November 2024 I was a visiting Researcher at the University of Michigan (Ann Arbor). </p>    
                    <p class="lead mb-5">During my BSc and MSc I conducted research at the University of Porto, INESCTEC, and the University of Twente at different stages. Then, I conducted research at <a href="https://www.omron.com/sinicx/">Omron Sinic X Corp.</a>, in Tokyo. Throughout, most of my projects had a focus on data science and human behaviour modelling.</p>
